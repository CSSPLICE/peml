# Example demonstrating parser issue caused by inconsistent block definitions.
# The first line of the first block dictates how subsequent blocks are delimited.
# Because the first block begins with a 'display', all blocks must start similarly.
# As such, all content until the next valid'"display' is considered part of the 
# previous block. Due to this, blockids become incorrectly associated with earlier
# blocks, creating a cascading misalignment effect. Namely, the first block is 
# incorrectly paired with id2 and so on.
