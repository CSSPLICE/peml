# Simple swap function assessed by the order of the blocks.
# Technically this is a Java exercise, but this is a moot point
# because the assessment is by block order.
# No indentation is required.
# Illustrates fixed code shown to students.
# Illustrates a multi-line block.
# Illustrates two forms of distractor. One is a "pick-one" distractor
# where the user must pick exactly one of a group of blocks (many
# systems will give visual signaling that these are grouped).
# The other is a block that cannot appear in the answer.
# Uses starter code instead of fixed blocks.
