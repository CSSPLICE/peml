# Simple example of a problem that is assessed by the order of the
# blocks. No indentation is expected/supported.
# This is a minimalist version: No blockids or dependencies. Grading
# is on simple (implicit) block order. There is one distractor, to be ignored.
# This is (nominally) a Python example.
# Derived from jsParsons.
