# Demonstration of intermixed "fixed" blocks with other blocks,
# similar to "fixed-demo-multi". However, this uses
# [assets.code.starter.files] to define the start and end code.

Put the blocks in the proper order.

# Define bounding content (before and after the moveable blocks)
# using [assets.code.starter.files].

Fixed Start
  This block goes at the beginning
  of the exercise.
  ___
Fixed End
      This block appears at the end.

# Note that the DAG implied by the depends tags
# only indicates the relative positioning of the
# adjustable blocks. It is the responsibility of the system
# implementation to deal with things like how the fixed blocks are
# displayed with respect to the orderable blocks, and limiting where
# the user can place an orderable block so that things appear in a
# reasonable order.
