title: Palindromes (A Simple PEML Example)

topics: Strings, loops, conditions
prerequisites: variables, assignment, boolean operators

instructions:----------
Write a program that reads a single string (in the form of one line
of text) from its standard input, and determines whether the string is
a _palindrome_. A palindrome is a string that reads the same way
backward as it does forward, such as "racecar" or "madam". Your
program does not need to prompt for its input, and should only generate
one line of output, in the following
format:

&lt;pre&gt;
"racecar" is a palindrome.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or:

&lt;pre&gt;
"Flintstone" is not a palindrome.
&lt;/pre&gt;
