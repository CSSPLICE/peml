instructions:----------
The following declaration introduces a variable named `jessica`
that refers to a `Jeroo`, and also creates a new instance of the
`Jeroo` class that starts off facing the default direction.
Add parameters
to the constructor call so the Jeroo starts out facing south
with 2 flowers.
