instructions:----------
Write your instructions here (using markdown and/or html tags).

Include images or resources using relative links, which are resolved relative
to the "public_html" key.

markdown-style image: ![my picture](image1.png)
or html: <img src="image2.png" alt="my second picture"/>

Use fenced code blocks:

```java
if (something.hasProperty())
{
  System.out.println("ok!");
}
```
----------

# By convention, relative URLs in the instructions refer to contents
# in the subdirectory named "public_html" alongside
# this PEML description (or packaged in its zip file), or you can
# specify a different URL or file set
# public_html: url(public_html)


# Can support multiple languages/systems, but only one shown here for
# simplicity
[systems]
language: Java
version: >= 1.9

# All associated resources are, by convention, found in appropriately
# named subdirectories located alongside this PEML description (or
# packaged in its zip file).

# Place any initial source files that students are given as a starting
# point for creating their answer in:
# src/starter/...

# Place any (optional) test suite files in:
# suites/...

# Place any (optional) solution(s) you have in directories like:
# solutions/<name-of-solution>/...
#
# Use the solution name "reference" for a reference solution, if you
# have one.

# Place any additional files (set the discussion of environments) in:
# environment/start/...
# environment/build/...
# environment/run/...
# environment/test/...

# If multiple systems are listed, system-specific resources default to
# the following subdirectories by convention, adding to/replacing any
# from the non-system-specific directories listed above:
# systems/<language-name>/src/...
# systems/<language-name>/src/solutions/<name-of-solution>/...
# systems/<language-name>/suites/...
# systems/<language-name>/environment/start/...
# systems/<language-name>/environment/build/...
# systems/<language-name>/environment/run/...
# systems/<language-name>/environment/test/...
# etc.
