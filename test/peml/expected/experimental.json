A palindrome is a string that reads the same way\nbackward as it does forward, such as \"racecar\" or \"madam\". Your\nprogram does not need to prompt for its input, and should only generate\none line of output, in the following\nformat:\n\n```\n\"racecar\" is a palindrome.\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\n\"Flintstone\" is not a palindrome.\n```\n",
