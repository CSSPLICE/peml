# Example demonstrating parser issue caused by inconsistent block definitions.
# The first line of the first block dictates how subsequent blocks are delimited.
# Because the first block begins with a 'blockid', all blocks must start similarly.
# Here, the third block lacks an initial 'blockid', causing it to be interpreted
# as a continuation of the previous block. This results in the second block's
# 'display' field being overridden and leaves only two arrangeable blocks: 
# "print('Good')" and "print('World!')".
