blockid: inNP
display: Show that INDEPENDENT SET is in NP.
depends:

blockid: algorithm
display: Nondeterministically guess some subset of the vertices. If this set is at least of size k (k is the parameter to the decision problem), and the vertices are all independent, then return YES. Otherwise return NO.
depends: inNP

blockid: d1
display: Nondeterministically guess some collection of vertices. If the vertices are independent, and if it is the biggest such set, then return YES. Otherwise return NO.
depends: -1

display: 2. Show that INDEPENDENT SET is NP-hard by using a reduction
of known NP-comlete problem CLIQUE to IS.

blockid: d3
display: 2. Show that INDEPENDENT SET is NP-hard by using a reduction
of IS to known NP-complete problem CLIQUE.
depends: -1

blockid: starthard
display: Show transformations to reduce ``CLIQUE`IS`` to ``IS`CLIQUE``.
depends: NPhard

blockid: reduce
display: To reduce a [CLIQUE|IS] input instance to an [IS|CLIQUE] input instance for a given graph $G = (V , E)$, construct a complementary graph $G' = (V' , Eâ€™)$ such that:
depends: starthard

blockid: step1
display: a. $V = V'$. That is, the complement graph will have the same vertices as the original graph.
depends: reduce

blockid: step2
display: b. $E'$ is the complement of $E$ that is $G'$ has all the edges that is <b>not</b> present in $G$.
depends: step1

blockid: polynomial
display: Construction of the complementary graph can be done in polynomial time.
depends: step2

blockid: iff
display: We need to show that with this reduction, there is an independent set of size k in the complement graph if and only iff there exists a clique of size k in G.
depends: step2

blockid: if
display: <b>If there is an independent set of size $k$ in the complement graph $G'$</b>, it implies no two vertices share an edge in $G'$, which further implies all of those vertices share an edge with all others in $G$ forming a clique. That is, <b>there exists a clique of size $k$ in $G$</b>.
depends: iff

blockid: onlyif
display: 
<b>If there is a clique of size $k$ in the graph $G$</b>, it implies all vertices share an edge with all others in $G$, which further implies no two of these vertices share an edge in $G'$ (thus forming an Independent Set. That is, <b>there exists an independent set of size $k$ in $G'$</b>.
